1. Stop eating ultra-processed food:

Hotel foods and food delivery apps may tempt you with convenience and taste, but they often lack nutritional balance and contain excessive oil, salt, sugar, and additives.
These factors can negatively affect your health and calorie control.
Take charge of your meals by cooking at home with fresh, wholesome ingredients to ensure better nutrition.

2. Avoid hotel foods and uninstall all the food delivery apps:

Ultra-processed food includes items altered with added fats, starches, sugars, salts, and hydrogenated oils extracted from other foods.

To avoid them, eliminate them from your shopping list and keep them out of sight

3. increase intake of lean protein, low-calorie vegetables, and fruits:

Lean protein, found in sources like chicken, fish, eggs, tofu, beans, and lentils, is essential for building and maintaining muscle mass. It boosts metabolism and curbs overeating.
Low-calorie vegetables and fruits are rich in vital nutrients, antioxidants, and fiber, enhancing digestion, immunity, and overall health.

4. Walk for 40 to 60 minutes and do 3 workouts per week:

Walking is a simple yet effective calorie-burning and cardiovascular exercise.
Commit to a daily 40 to 60-minute walk to support weight loss and overall fitness.
Incorporate three weekly workouts that can vary in intensity to challenge your fitness level further. These workouts will contribute to your progress in this phase.
